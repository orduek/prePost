Preliminary analysis of the prepost pilot study - assessing free recall using simple NLP tools and neuroimaging

## Embedding Recall to fMRI data
He we use varation of presented works (see: https://naturalistic-data.org/content/Natural_Language_Processing.html, and https://github.com/snastase/encling-tutorial) to try and combine fMRI and audio data.
In this experiment subjects were in the fMRI while recalling an event from their lives (traumatic, rumination, mundane). 
We try to predict embedded info through brain and then compare these between "conditions"

### This work is preliminary so please don't grab and use the code without further evaluation.

Thank you!
